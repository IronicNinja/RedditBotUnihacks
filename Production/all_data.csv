1,"Predictions for GME, the GME squeeze and immediate future state of WSB","Hello retards, 


&nbsp;



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is my first long post on WSB and I'm here to give you some predictions on what will happen now, after GME, and the state of WSB after GME. Also I'm extremely bored being the weekend and all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, this is the first essay that I've written since my master's thesis.
I know you can't read for shit but I just have to get this off my chest and hopefully save you some money.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the new influx of people here - **THIS ABSOLUTELY CONCERNS YOU TOO!!!** There will be no **TL;DR** nor a **TL;CR**. If you can't read or don't want to read, here's a 🚀. Go fuck yourself.


# I. What happens now with GME?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all some background on me and then we'll get to the good stuff: Software engineer at a very big company, ex-CTO in 2 failed startups.
One of the startups failed miserably and the other obtained 500k in VC funding and then failed miserably.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't believe in short squeezes as an investing framework. Short squeezes are price actions where one side gets the stick and the other gets the carrot. The problem is that, more likely than not, the side that gets the stick is also the side that's right.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shitron, in his shitty video, although he was wrong 90% of the way, he was right in one instance: There is a reason why short interest is high in a security - the business is failing or expected to fail.
Now ask yourself this: do you want to put money on the line in the hopes of someone, although that someone is right, gets margin called, then his margin call triggers other margin calls, and you somehow sell at the top and not left hanging with heavy bags worth nothing? Fuck me that's retarded beyond any autism spectrum. 
If you 'invest' in short squeezes you deserve to lose it all or, if you orchestrated it, go to jail like that Martin Skreli guy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GME will get to high triple digits sooner or later thanks to the small amount of float, low total number of shares, and current low market cap - so this isn't done yet! 
The increase is not because of a price action, it's because Cohen took over, he's serious about digital transformation, omnichannel, has cash and most importantly has a good management team backing him up.
The guys that are shorting need to get out, not because they will get margin called, but because they are wrong.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some pretty good DDs out there and won't go through them as you should start using google / reddit search to feed your confirmation bias. 
The only DD that caught my eye is the VC funding one, which is why I told you my background:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven't read it, go read it - it's good - it's also a painful trip down on memory lane from the time when I was talking to VCs, clients and investors. I firmly believe that the guy is right and this is a very possible future of GME.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other hand, GME as a business doesn't want to squeeze & be known for a pump and dump. 

**Why?** 

- Because they have a business to run and not some elaborate scam; 
- GME wants to grow organically but cannot do so with this amount of short interest so they most likely will bail the shorts out at some point; 
- Who here don't like **free money**?;
- Their bottom line matters. They want to have the capital to pay down high-interest rate debts and they also want to have money to start investing in growth.


**When?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck me if I know. If I knew I'd be a freaking billionaire not ranting on the internet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there's a scenario where this doesn't squeeze at all and the price increases instantly, then GME issues shares, then from that point forward the growth story begins. Be ready for this scenario and temper your expectations accordingly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up on GME there are 2 very possible scenarios that I see in the near future: 

1. GME will squeeze hard and reach high triple digits soon, go back down hard and then growth begins;
2. GME will issue shares, bail out the shorts, pay down its debt and then have free-fuel to rocket into that 50B valuation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, be prepared to hold for a few years if the 2nd scenario comes to fruition or get back in after the squeeze and hold for a few years.


# II. What happens after GME?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of you are going to have money available. **A LOT OF MONEY**, by your standards. A lot of you small fish, smooth brained, extra chromosomal, autistic retards are going to want **MORE!!!** 
The truth is, you got lucky, this is one in a decade event, there is no next GME. Keep in mind that the best funds out there make 20% per year. In the long run, you will do worse!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that we should get out of the way: WSB is NOT a pump and dump sub-reddit where someone posts some DD and then everyone else puts money in. That's stupid, that's not how investing works, that's not what this sub is about. To top it all, we don't have the capital to have any meaningful impact on the market. But, but, but...shut up, nobody is going to pump some worthless piece of shit so you can get out.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a very good post on how to identify a pump and dump here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jdvfok/the_anatomy_of_a_wsb_pump_and_dump/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read that motherfucker like it's your bible. Better yet, fuck the bible, fuck Jesus, fuck Buddha and fuck whatever else you fucks worship. That post needs to be printed on paper, laminated, by your bedside, indexed per line and when someone says [4:23] you'd better know the word at that location.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My GME average is somewhere around $16 per share, quite high by some standards, but that's because I didn't believe in the original thesis, I didn't know when Cohen would get serious and quite frankly, from my perspective, before October, the conditions just weren't there for me to risk money on this. I spent 100 hours+ researching GME before I put a dollar in. I only put money in when I was knowledgeable enough to risk it. You fucks need to do the same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WSB is a corner near the ghetto-supermarket where drug dealers, hookers, retards and currency traders meet up to share ideas. If you new retards don't believe me, search for a dude named Variation Separate (or something like that) and the red river of loss that followed. Some of the guys here will have had an episode of PTDS after reading that name, You fuckers need to understand that there are some shady people here, that will sound smart, be smart and are after **YOUR HARD EARNED CASH**. Even if they aren't after your money, they can still be dead wrong.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will post a TA chart, filled with crayons, support lines, MACDs and all sorts of math equations and you retards will go all in thinking - this is the big one - here comes the money train - choo choo! Yeah the train is here, but you are on the tracks!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for new traders, old traders and everyone else here, when investing, I have the following pieces of advice for you:

- do well at your job and earn risk-free money;
- stick to what you know - aka the business segment you're currently employed in. You will most likely beat **MOST IF NOT ALL** analysts, because you have more intimate day-to-day knowledge;
- if you decide to invest in something else than your current expertise, like gourds or GME, do the research, read 10Ks Qs, S1s, 13Fs, 13Ds, form 4s etc. READ READ READ and get it through your thick skull that nobody else here is going to do it for you;
- learn to spot bullshit!

### Did you play GME?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, you are winning. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be humble, be smart with your money and most importantly, when this is done, take some god damn time off the market maybe even time off work and relax! I know I will. You will have deserved it.

### You didn't play GME?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucks, but you have an opportunity to learn. Learn why the trade happened, learn the conditions that lead to this trade. This will happen again 10-20 years from now in another context, something will be different but you'll be able to spot it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# III. The state of WSB after GME

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-read the previous segment. I think Pumps and dumps and next GMEs will be rampant.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll also see 3 main categories joining:

1. Noobs. You new retards will do well here and lose a lot of money;
2. Hedge fund chads. These guys will start reading through the shit here and try to find ways to fuck you, your wife and your wife's boyfriend. Get ready for pegging if you don't start reading; 
3. Pump and dump scalping sharks. These guys will try to trick you into a pump and dump scheme on a company nobody ever heard of and take your money. It's your own god damn fault for pressing buy/sell so act accordingly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not financial advice! Compulsory GME diamond rockets at the end.

This is one of the most concise points made in an article I've read in a while, and they simply don't list any of the other catalysts for the stock. No mention of Cathie Woods accumulating shares, no mention of demo day on the horizon. No mention of the float structure and Mithril potentially buying the locked up shares. 

Seriously, who writes this stuff? It's almost like the chief editors of every financial publication agency are telling people to only write about WSB. This is really weird and it gives me the heebie jeebies. How can someone claiming to be a professional financial publication simply omits so many key facts about PLTR?

3,"For every dollar that is made here, two dollars are lost","This sub is incredible. There are incredible ideas and ideas that are so dumb that a monkey throwing darts would pick better stocks (oops). Fortunately, or unfortunately, it seems both types of ideas can make you money. 

To the people buying travel stock during a global pandemic when airliners are flying at 20% capacity (or less) or Hertz... it’s gambling. I support people doing what they want with their money, but following blind idiots who are maxing a credit card for a trade is fucking moronic. At times, it’s like watching a retiree throw away hundreds of dollars a day at a slot machine. 

I believe for every dollar made here, two dollars are lost. Seeing someone, such as DFV, make $11m off $50k is the greatest advertisement ever. Many will see it and ask, how did he do it? They will “learn,” aka have no fucking idea, what an option is and proceed to lose thousands with the hope of making millions and quitting their job all while simultaneously getting revenge on their wife’s boyfriend. 

Again, there is great advice here and truly smart people. There are also addicts who will say anything about a stock because they own $100 in an option. I’ve messaged with people who didn’t know the difference between a put and a call while holding 5+ figures of contracts and making less than $20 an hour. 

My message? Please throw amounts of money at ideas that you’re willing to walk away from. Do not jeopardize your retirement, wife’s boyfriend’s new boat, or your children’s education on a DD from some 16 year old who has $50 in Victoria secret because boobs are getting bigger.

5,"$BB will moon in the short term, but not because of fundamentals.","As all you BBheads knows, the QNX is BlackBerrys flagship product. A software for your car that makes it smarter than all you retards in this community combined. They make alot of other products and has historically been very innovative products (yes maybe not when mr stevey jobs smashed it with the smartphone). But all of that does not really matter.

 What matters now is the WSB megamainstream storm that we are currently in and will be after the gme squeeze is over (which its not, it just got the start signal last friday). But look at this now, GME was thought to be a blockbuster company but hardcore WSBers did their homework and unleashed the massive autist attack. WSB saw a big increase in traders during 2020, globally we went from roughly 4-5% retail traders to a staggering 20% in 2020. 

We are getting unprecedented attention, they see us as the community that revived a dying brick and mortar retailer and surged the stock price. The same goes for $BB. The company was seen as a dying one when they couldn't keep up with their competitors in the phone game. They have completely changed and with this GME thing, people will jump on the rocket ship like never before since $BB has garnered huge attention in the mists of  the GME play. New hoards of people are lurking in this subreddit trying to find our next play. If you like money this train has not even left the station yet and the price is still a steal.

6,What Everyone is Getting Wrong About GME,"WSB Controls GME Sentiment, not the Price.

&#x200B;

Long read here but there is analogy using the Magic School bus so........yeah.

TL:DR: at bottom.

I've seen far too many people on this sub, Stinktwits, Tweeter, CNBC, WSJ, Barron's etc. incorrectly state that WSB is controlling GME.  We have not, nor will we ever be in control of GME.  Simply put, our \~5% ownership isn't enough to push the price around.  As much as you retards, and the retard(s) on CNBC, and the retards on print media WANT everyone to believe it, its just not true so I wanted to clarify a few things going forward.

First, the media, Shitron, and others are trying to paint WSB as a collective or a whole entity, and NOT as a group of individuals.  This claim is baseless, and has been mentioned here before but of course that won't stop them.  If in fact we were a collective, that would set a dangerous precedent and we would almost certainly be shut down.  Think of like Pirate Bay. If one person illegally uploads a movie that person is in violation of the law, but if 10000 people upload a couple seconds of said movie, and those pieces are stitched together it becomes a lot harder to make it illegal.

The story of GME began much like M. Burry's big short began - someone looked!  That person was r/DeepFuckingValue (and M. Burry, himself).  Let's use the Magic School Bus as an example. DFV is played by Ms. Frizzle. Here she comes around the bend in her little short bus on route to pick you mini autists up, but when she opens the door to the bus no one gets on!  Ms. Frizzle is not discouraged, so she wrangles you retards up and throws you on the bus.  Off you go on the adventure of your life, launching into the stratosphere to discover a new planet further than the Moon and Mars. You name this newly found planet Valhalla.  When you return you can't stop telling people about your trip!

This is where we get to my point.  We are in control of the SENTIMENT surrounding GME, not the price.   You little autists have seen valhalla already, and can't stop telling others about how magical it is. Soon enough, other autists want to ride the short bus out to Valhalla, and so they buy their tickets (stonks) and then they tell their friends etc etc.  Take Tesla for example (with a P/E of 1700), does that stop the ~~retards~~ geniuses from buying?

This is what we are doing to GME.  We didn't push our weight around as WSB and somehow, singlehandedly destroy the shorts.  No, retail just doesn't have that kind of power (hence why its B.S the media is pushing the narrative...LOL though they sure know how to make an autist blush).  WSB somehow, SOMEHOW edgeukated enough people on the GME story about how undervalued they were, financially healthy they were, how shorted the stock was, Lord Cohen et al, etc, and the story took off.

You see? We are controlling the SENTIMENT around GME which in turn, is controlling the price.  Lets continue this going forward because its what got us to where we are.  If we really want this squeeze to happen there is going to have to be conviction on behalf of the buyers.  So go out there and edgeukate more people on the stock that everyone missed (apart from you DFV (xoxo) and Burry).

Make sure they know this ain't no pump and dump. Everyone gets caught up in the stonk price when they should be looking at market cap.  Sure, we hit the highest price last week, but not the highest  market cap GME has ever had. In reality, we've just recently corrected to the proper valuation GME should have been at all along (if it weren't for those greedy shorts!).

So next time you post about GME, make sure you remind people about the above points and the fact that  the squeeze hasn't squoze yet, and that RC and Reggie Fils Aime are now driving this short bus!

You keep the SENTIMENT high, the stonk price goes more uppies.

(someone add a rocket emoji...or perhaps a school bus?)

TL/DR:  WSB is controlling the SENTIMENT around GME, not the price.

13,Buying Shares with Margin Accounts Doesn't Starve Shorts,"Lots of new people here who may not understand how brokerage accounts work. If you have a margin account, meaning you get instant deposit, instant settlement and you can only make a certain amount of of daytrades if you are under the 25k PDT limit, you signed up for a margin account.


Margin accounts let you trade with borrowed funds while your transactions settle, as opposed to a cash account in which you exclusively use your own funds to make transactions and have to wait a few days for them to clear before your funds are available again.


When you signed up for a margin account, you agreed that your holdings aren't necessarily directly yours. Instead, your holdings are held in your broker's margin pool which they lend out to other brokers and institutions while essentially writing you an IOU for your portion of the pool until you decide to transact again. The shares you bought are being lent out to others and the broker is collecting the interest in the meantime until you sell your holdings. This is one way brokers such as Robinhood and TDA make money.


The good news is the price action you're seeing right now is happening regardless of all of this. The bad news is buying and holding shares is probably allowing shorts to average down positions.

This info is in the margin account terms of service/customer agreement and RH has direct documentation saying they are lending your securities:

As said in previous posts, the shorts CAN’T BUY BACK all the shares they shorted. This means that WE decide at which price we are going to sell them our shares. And as far as I know there are no more reason for it to be 1000$ than 1000000$ 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If everybody agrees already to put limit sells at 1000$ we can be pretty sure that the price will never really go much further. 

And it would be much more interesting to see how far this whole shit can go

16,PSA: Simplified Facts For New Retards,"Fellow tardsickles and autismos, lend me your smoothbrains. I'm here to post a few simple factoids that (gay) bear repeating. Thousands of retards are a-joining every day, and 🌈 🐻s are trying on their green strap-ons out for size. (Who knew conversion therapy lay within videogame stores?) 

Also, earlier posts used a lot of $10-words and I know most of you can’t read, let alone add. But remember, this isn't investment advice, it's simply a reminder of the basic scenario for those of you who don't understand/care to understand the technical aspects of this incredible scenario at hand. 

Edit: TL;DR: 

1. The short squeeze happens when the price rises beyond short sellers’ ability to pay interest on borrowed shares, and outstanding shares are too scarce to continue shorting. 
2. If you are in team squoze, set limit orders at ridiculous levels so shares can’t be borrowed by shorts. 
3. Don’t use margin to buy calls unless you’re willing to sell everything you have, and you’re not helping the squeeze as much as buying shares. 
4. But buy calls because you’re still helping the squeeze. 

Positions: 20 shares @63 + 50 1/29 C

1. \*\*The short squeeze.\*\* This occurs when the price is driven too high for short sellers to maintain their positions. The interest expense becomes too high to maintain. At some point their brokers will perform a margin call. Long Story Short ™  (which is the name of the book that I will write about this), this will force the shorts to buy shares. The short squeeze can only continue if buyers hold their shares and keep on buying. If you sell, you're limiting your potential along with other shareholders.  
2. \*\*Limit orders.\*\* By placing limit orders on your shares, market makers can't borrow them. However, you'd want to set these limits at absurd prices in case the price spikes really high and you miss out on further gains, plus the shares being available again. 
3. \*\*The gamma squeeze that got squoze on Friday.\*\* Why? Because the highest call strike being surpassed. Market makers must buy shares to hedge against short calls. For the sake of your chromosomes, don't worry about the technical aspects, only that this means market makers are now forced to drive up the price every time it hits the highest strike. While highly correlated with the short squeeze, it's not causal. It can only continue if the highest strike is met on a rolling basis. 
4. \*\*Using margin.\*\* I still see some of you late night chucklers talking about buying on margin. Buying on margin is borrowing, and large price drops may propel a margin call on YOU and the subsequent liquidation your other positions. Buying calls on margin might also not help the short squeeze get squoze, but smarter retards than me can correct me if I'm wrong.  
5. \*\*But but.\*\* This doesn’t mean you can't make money buying calls. Buy all means. 

For those looking to further the short squeeze, Rosie up that fucking Riveter. 🚀🚀🚀 Put simple for all you ass burgers, each time you press the buy button, Mr. Left’s pee pee huwties, while yours grows closer to that of your wife’s boyfriend’s.🚀🚀🚀

You know the cheesy little yellow crescent on the mobile above your retard-crib?  🌙  🌙  🌙  🌙  🌙   And how your nubby little tard hand can’t quite reach it while you lie there and giggle late into the night you fucking late night chucklers? Well that’s where you're going my little smartie tardies—if you use your extra chromosomes to buy $GME shares.

17,My DD on undervalued EV play $FSR (Same guy that brought you $FUBO & $WBA) 🚀🚀🚀,"Hello fellow degenerates - 

**If you don’t know,** **I'm the guy that brought you the $WBA DD (Which went on to make all time highs after a week or so) & the $FUBO DD (after the short report when no one wanted it)…. Went on to do over 30% in a couple of days.** 

Before we get into my DD on this next play, I want to note the mods have given my other profile (Woodncrate) a ban for no reason whatsoever, so I am forced to post on this account. Judging by all the messages, you guys banked out big time on my last 3 plays & I couldn't resist bringing you more free tendies! 

Alright, back to my next play that you can catch **before** she BOOMS... $FSR. 

The entire EV sector has priced in 5-10 years of growth in current stock prices and IMO the only way for most of those to go is... Down. Fisker on the other hand has been a real laggard in one of the hottest sectors of 2020 & poised for a moon mission. This is one of the only quality EV companies that **hasn't** experienced this forward thinking price explosion. 

Currently trading at $14.80 $FSR is grossly undervalued. Median price targets set at $21, another high at $26 and I predict many more to come in the near future. I disagree with all of these PT’s and believe $FSR short-term PT is $30+ and long-term PT set north of $100. 

**Catalysts / Positive notes:** 

* 1 billion cash reserve arsenal for marketing & distribution
* Fisker Ocean will be built by **Magna Steyr** in Europe. (Magna rumored to be constructing Apple's new EV... This alone will send the stock in sympathy. Cathie Woods also been loading $MGA stock last couple of weeks - She always comes through for us! 
* 11,000 paid reservations thus far & growing rapidly. 
* Set to Reveal Production Ocean SUV at the Los Angeles Auto Show, May 2021
* (Proprietary Next Gen Driver Assistance) **Replacing Lidar**: Digital imaging radar! 1st to market in Fisker Ocean EV. Supporting higher levels of autonomy. This alone could send the stock to $100+ IMO. 
* From $37,499 before the $7,500 federal tax incentive! Affordable electric SUV arriving in 2022.
* From Barrons, **""Several EV stocks** ***Barron’s*** **tracks are up roughly 500% over the past year**. Fisker's time could be any minute IMO.

18,The rise of retard/retail investors: A WSB saga,"I know you retards are probably thinking about the boner you will get seeing your GME gains tomorrow.

In past few days, I have seen backlash in media regarding Reddit investor. Also, I have seen some self-proclaimed financial advisors making posts in WSB or other forums. I have nothing against this. The point is clear ""Institutions are not particularly happy with the rise of retard investors"". 

Lets talk about market valuation. In my retarded option, it is arbitrary. It's not like Newton's third law which is valid  everywhere.  The arbitrary nature of market valuation has been  proven very well in 2020. An example: Tesla (WSB's favorite stock in 2020) was valued at **80B** or less a year ago. Now it’s valued at 800B. I am doing my PhD in Electrical Engineering. And, I understood the value in Tesla’s technology when I bought the stock in 2019. Not just me, my colleagues in other automakers did too. But, there was so much opposition from the so called analyst. Most of them called it overvalued in the prices in the beginning of 2020. I sold at the beginning of 2020 after I made 80% gain (paper hand I know). After seeing the rise of Tesla, I have become wary of listening to financial analyst on valuation of a company. Sure, retail investors don’t have the money to move the market unless in exceptional cases like GME, Tesla etc. Therefore, we have no choice but to follow the analyst.

It is true that institutions do have more data. But, I have to come to the conclusion that they are as clueless as the next person when it comes to valuation. Valuation in the market is more like **faith (**I am not religious). The valuation of a company is defined by what the big institutions believe it should be. It doesn’t matter what model you use for valuation or how deep your understanding of the underlying product/service/technology. 

These big institutions have a bunch of retard called Analyst. In most cases, these analyst are not necessarily expert in the technology they are evaluating e.g. Tesla. Their job is to form a compelling argument to justify their own price targets. Why? Because the firm they work for has most likely invested in the stock and want the price to move up. The same way, when they sell it or have taken profit, they down grade it to create the next entry point. So, these analyst are basically trying to manipulate the prices. And, they have been able to do that because they manage large amount of money.

Why the institution are angry now? The market volatility has increased. Look at valuations of stocks in 2020. What happened in 2020? COVID. Yes. Also, retail investors started influencing market and a lot of them stopped listening to financial analyst. Why is that bad? Because, big institutions have been controlling the market for decades. They were happy when retail investors just bought ETFs or mutual funds etc. and let the big guys control the market. 

The rise of WSB and retail investors coming together for a stock has created uncertainty in the market. There are narrative now that this has made the market irrational ( some guy posted this in one of the reddit forum). Total bullshit. Now, imagine how the bosses of these analyst feel, when they are sitting with shit load of data and telling they should not buy a stock because they think it should be valued at X. Then, comes a bunch of retards who buy OTM calls and cause gamma squeeze and price shoots up. It makes the analyst and the institution look like bunch of fools. If this trend continues, institution will loose their grip in the market and more people may choose to manage their own money instead of handing it to institutions. 

TLDR: Don't always believe analyst or people who claim they have X years of experience when it comes to valuation. Don't out rightly dismiss them either. So, if someone says GME should be valued at X, it does not mean they are right. Believe in your play. GME to moon  🚀🚀🚀. 🤝 🤝 💎💎

19,A Closer Glance at Nokia,"Sup glue sniffers. I’ve seen some Nokia thirst posts over the past couple weeks, and figured I’d look into the company. I used to have a windows phone, and while the OS was absolute shit, the phone itself was solid. NOK also ended trading at 4.20 on Friday so I figured why not look into it.  After briefly looking over the past couple quarterly reports, I’ve found Nokia is as resilient as the phones it manufactures. Today I’m discussing the long term case for Nokia.

**DISCLAIMER:** I don’t get paid for this. I’m not a professional. I’m not giving financial advice. I won’t have a lot of pretty charts in this so just eat some fucking crayons like you normally do.

&#x200B;

**The Gossip**

As some of you less smooth-brained retards know, Nokia has been getting shat on from shareholder’s perspective over the past couple years. Seeing a few big dips in share price both in 2019 and 2020 (which I will explain later). It appears that a lot of traders have left the company by the wayside for corporations like Motorola (MSI) and Cisco (CSCO).

**I see you lookin’**

Investment Journalists have already been discussing speculative success for Nokia long-term.

Here are some examples:

Cramer said he prefers growth, but with Nokia's long-existing foothold in many facets of the telecom industry AND Pekka Lundmark's EXPLICTLY EXPRESSED focus for Nokia's efforts on dominating a specific niches of mobile access:

>“We have a strong position in technologies that are important for critical networks, such as open and virtualized radio access networks and we are on course for a 100% cloud-native software portfolio,”

We are looking at serious growth within a particular spectrum (spectrum, like frequency spectrum HAHA TELECOM JOKE) and I think it dubious to dismiss Nokia's potential for growth where it *wants* to grow.

**Oh look blue crayons**

Here is a nice, smol-brained visual expression of Nokia’s 2020 weighted 5G conversion rate so that you fuckwits can grasp what’s going on.

&#x200B;

[Source: https:\/\/www.nokia.com\/system\/files\/2020-10\/nokia\_results\_2020\_q3.pdf \(pg. 4\)](https://preview.redd.it/73g1gglcjcd61.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71f43fd792c1559a7df369c1c4198252f7697d1)

The dotted square represents all of Nokia’s existing 4G footprint at the end of 2018 and the dark blue represents where a 5G footprint has been created to replace it. Notice that some dark blue exists outside the dotted square? That’s all NEW STUFF LOOKIE THERE FELLA UR SO SMART. At the same time, some of the 4G footprint remains because of interest in providing service to..um.. legacy products?

As of the Q3 report, Nokia owns 27% of the 4G + 5G mobile radio market share- excluding the Chinese market for that matter. This hasn't been a company that has lacked resources or experience, but direction and focus; there is a LOT to telecommunications and there are many doors this company can take. It has the connections, money, and focus necessary to achieve these long-term goals that its leaders set. If done right, 2021 won’t be a year of killer cash flow and revenue, but will establish Nokia with one massive cock.

I know it’s not exactly flashy/sexy and won’t see immediate results in the next two or three quarters, but the newly appointed Chief Technical Officer, Nishant “Big Daddy” Batra knows R&D and knows the ins and outs of Cloud Service Programs. Nokia has some BIG brain boys steering the ship. Let’s talk about something you troglodytes can follow: money.

Net sales, operating profit, and margin are on track for another consistent year albeit *slightly* lower than 2019. This is good news considering that it lost a large north American customer this previous year due to its lackluster 5G footprint WHICH Lundmark (the aforementioned new president of Nokia) has explicitly stated that this will be the primary focus: R&D in tech that will position it as a long-term leader in the 5G space. They can do it too. I’ll dumb it down for you retards:

Boys, this is FISCALLY-DISCIPLINED leadership.

“BuT sHoUldN’T aLL lEadErShIp bE gOoD wItH mOneY??”

First, shut the fuck up and let me explain. There was a major dip in share price in 2019 after Nokia announced that it would not be paying dividends for two consecutive quarters. The boomers and gay bears in r/investing didn’t like the sound of that and decided to sell to really stick it to Nokia, and bought shit like CRUS because MMs told their sheep to.

**Nokia cut dividends temporarily in order to offset the cost of rolling out 5G tech**. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g)

It was supposed to be a short term biting of the bullet for shareholders in order to see long term benefits, but God forbid people didn’t get their 19 cent-a-share dividends. There has been open discussion of bringing back dividends within the next couple years if the company sees continued growth in its cash flow, Nokia mentions the possibility of:

>“an earnings-based growing dividend of approximately 40% to 70% of non-IFRS diluted EPS, taking into account Nokia’s cash position and expected cash flow generation.”

*source:* [*https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21)

If Nokia officially announces a re-rolling out of dividends, boomers will get  **Rock. Fucking. Hard.** and slurp up shares on the cheap. This is where speculation comes in and is **ultimately why I am posting this shit in WSB.** Nokia has some major competition, minus Huawei in the United States which is a big fucking deal and I’m amazed how that escapes people considering the recent contracts Nokia secured with the US government. Some of that competition currently has the leg up on Nokia and betting on them is risky, but if Nokia can prove within the next year that it has a plan, we have got some SERIOUS upward potential.

Also, check the options activity on Nokia for the next 2 weeks leading up to its Q4 report. It’s getting me \~frisky\~

I could further dissect additional strategies associated with Nokia’s portfolio including what else it has it’s toes in, but big picture: Nokia will begin to hone in on a specific set of specializations (5G and Cloud-native software services).

I have a few thousand bucks on the side that I am willing to lose. I was wondering what's the optimal way to spend them so that GME rises. On the one hand I cancbuy calls with high delta, so MMs have to buy stocks to hedge OR buy puts so they have to short shares to hedge, leaving less shares available to short. This would increase fees and put pressure on shorts triggering an even more massive squeeze.

25,$UBER 2021 Reopening Trade,"Alright, I believe that UBER is an under appreciated stonk that deserves some more attention, here is why and for you retards who can’t read see the TLDR at the bottom.

1. Cost structure changes due to the pandemic.

For those paying attention Uber has been in a state of transformation over the past year. The pandemic forced leadership to cut the fat and sell off all the projects that were keeping it from profitability. A recent example is the sale of Blade their chopper service, which while cool as shit.. didn’t exactly have the right here right now core business of rides and eats in mind. Despite the sale, they still kept a strategic partnership with them for a rainy day if/when this business “takes off” pun intended.

2. Eats is growing at an incredible 135% during the pandemic making it a major contributor to the bottom line and offsetting the rides decline due to the pandemic.

3. The rides/eats combo post pandemic. 

As you all have seen, vaccines are getting out in arms and the virus is soon to be royally fucked which will bring back all the cool shit we used to know and love (concerts, going to a sporting event, house parties, clubs, bars, you name it..) and if you are like me.. no way you are gonna stop ordering your food now that you can click a button and have it show up in under an hour! I mean time is money and I’ll gladly pay an extra $5-10 on my meal to not have to get my ass up and dressed to go somewhere like a clown. 

So, if we keep using eats bc it’s part of our lifestyle and all the shit we used to do is back.. well Uber is gonna be how we get to and from all those reopened events. Plus, if I were a betting man, and I am, I would bet on pent up demand. 

4. Profitability 

Putting it all together, trimmed fat, increased business in the eats segment and the reopening of rides.. UBER is gonna be profitable in 2021. As a cherry on top, it is also number 1 or 2 in every market they operate in globally with a GIANT TAM (total addressable market).

TLDR: the pandemic has forced Uber to trim the fat. It has also sped up adoption of one of its slower units (prior to the pandemic) Eats, that I do not think is going away. As all the things we love open back up and let us in, Rides, which is already profitable should rebound nicely and drive the company to profits. So, go long! Get LEAPS or straight stonk. Do whatever but make sure you have some UBER exposure in your portfolios for 2021!",samstribling90,112,1611511590.0,13470.637778520584,DD,l44fcf,25,0.71,0.0,0.9466,0.9466,9.632225784889473,19.689,-0.5718060678259768,-0.5412716238040696

28,NVAX UPDATE 🚀 :: LIFTOFF SOON :: 🚀,"Fellow NVAX holders, new information has come to light through an 8k filing by NVAX on Friday:

“””
Between November 10, 2020 and January 20, 2021, the Company sold 3.6 million shares of its common stock resulting in $466.8 million in net proceeds at a weighted average sales price of $131.95 per share pursuant to its At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with the Sales Agent, dated as of November 10, 2020 (the “November 2020 Sales Agreement”), leaving $27.2 million remaining under the November 2020 Sales Agreement as of January 20, 2021. The Company and the Sales Agent terminated the November 2020 Sales Agreement by mutual agreement on the date hereof.
”””

So the reason we haven’t seen a run up to data release is because they were selling shares at $132. 

The company also filed for AN ADDITIONAL $500MM ATM offering. 

**************************************************

NVAX has added a supply chain exec and a regulatory exec, refreshed their ATM offering for an additional 500MM. 

News is coming soon. 

The pop may be dampened or may experience a dip on market open when it happens.

29,This needs to be said: taking GME profit is okay,"I like GME, a lot. 

I was trying to talk about GME back when you smooth brains only wanted to hear about PLTR. 

And you can see from my post history that I thought it was a $70/share company by April regardless of the squeeze, so I think I’m credible enough in saying this. 

But if you want to take profit now you 100% should. I’ve seen a lot of people make a lot of money, some of it life changing, and it has genuinely made me happy. But that profit has caused perhaps the greatest FOMO in WSB history—and some manipulative mother fuckers are feeding it. 

GME is not going to $1,000. Stop with that nonsense. That’s coming from people who get a dramatically better exit when you chase. Could it keep going up? Sure. Is it the best chance you’re going to see over the next year at its current price? No. 

If you want to let it all ride for a while, let it ride. But watch out for when GME issues more shares. They aren’t dumb people and that’s a pretty good signal. 

I’ll close with this. A lot of 🌈🐻 made insane profits in March during the market collapse. And a lot of them talked themselves into believing it was just the beginning because greed is powerful AF. 

Be nimble. Making money is way better than being convinced you’re right.",HorlickMinton,6972,1611524898.0,169.2566683292389,Discussion,l48hyy,0,0.36,0.5859,0.9681,1.5539999999999998,0.0,0.0,-1.7365843248428807,-2.6986520408058365
